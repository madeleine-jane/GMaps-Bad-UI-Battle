# GMaps-Bad-UI-Battle
An absurdly useless phone number input widget built in Flutter. 



This widget was created to purposefully demonstrate the violation of principles of human computer interaction. A user must input their phone number by scrolling to the latitude with a matching numerical value. 



This widget was built in Flutter, with a google maps plugin.
